Anybody who knows me, understands that I am obsessed with addiction. All kinds of addictions. I try to learn about hoarders, drug addicts, sex addicts, the whole gamut of dysfunctional people and what makes them dysfunctional. A part of this obsession stems from my own behaviour, and my own tendency to get wrapped up in different rabbit holes. Anyways, lets dive into the paper. From the title, it seems like we will see a lot of information about how the dopaminergic system of addicts changes as they go through their addiction. I wonder if the authors will support their information with animal models, or data collected from addicts? Read on.

Alright, from the excerpt at the top of the paper, it becomes clear that we will be seeing evidence from animal models with cocaine addictions, and the paper will discuss whether addiction results in dopamine sensitization or dopamine deficiencies. 

The authors explain it would be unwise to use humans to draw conclusions for their opinion piece as its tough to design good experiments that will provide good causal data. They highlight three important processes for giving drugs to their rats, long, short and intermittent access. 
Mesotelencephalic dopamine systems are the main culprit when we talk about addiction. From some article on the internet, these are the regions: “the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area that project to a number of regions including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, striatum, and prefrontal cortex.” Alright, so there a pocket of space in the basal ganglia region of your brain that probably gains more dopamine receptors or less as rats get addicted to cocaine. Still wanna ask, is it dopamine itself, or precusors or other chemicals produced from dopamine? Still don’t know, but still gotta ask. 

The authors discuss anhedonia, and that seems very sensible to me. Imagine the amount of media and clicks generated when you have an article that describes something like anhedonia. We all care about boredom. Getting rid of boredom always sells. When you like doing something so much, eventually it doesn’t hit the same way? This just seems like a part of life. You get tired of the same old songs. Why should snorting cocaine be any different? And will this primarily be a psychological process facilitated by the amount of neurotransmitters released by neurons, or do glial cells struggle to clean up the neurotransmitters and become less effective at metabolizing neurotransmitters over time, or does something happen to neurotransmitter receptors? Do we have a finite number of a certain type of enzyme producing cell that were just not built to deal with the sheer number of drugs an addict consumes? Who knows, let’s read on.

I also wonder if there is any research that intersect the default mode network and addiction. There should be regions of the brain that get more active as you spend less time away from your drug of choice, and that trigger some sort of withdrawal mechanism. I feel like these neurons will somehow override the important regions of the default mode network, making it harder for you to perform the mundane physiological needs your body requires to survive, and making you constantly think about your addiction and how you will satisfy that need. Some inhibitory neurons probably in the basal ganglia contribute to some sort of dampening of the prefrontal cortex. Anyways, I digress. Let’s get back to the paper at hand.

The reviewers address the most eye-catching part of the title, the “ups and downs.” Although, I expected it to do something with how addiction gets you high, it actually deals with whether cocaine addiction is an attempt to overcome dopamine deficiency as you produce less endogenous dopamine after getting addicted to cocaine. So, a similar situation to exogenous testosterone.

Another view is that getting addicted to cocaine sensitizes you to it, and you need more and more to get the same high. I feel like both arguments have merit, but my gut tells me overcoming dopamine deficiency is the right answer. Don’t ask me why.

Now we move on to the preclinical models. It’s important to understand how these experiments work if we want to come to some sort of conclusion about them. We will look at the patterns in which drugs are given to the rats, and see if there is any sort of insight we can gain from this.
